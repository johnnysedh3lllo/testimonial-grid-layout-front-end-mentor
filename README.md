## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
having tried this project before, it feels good to see my knowledge of CSS Grid flourish. this challenge helped me practice what i already know of CSS Grid, so i didn't exactly learn anything new, i only reinforced what i learnt with practice.

### Continued development
in other projects i will focus more on building websites with responsive layouts and having them scale properly.
